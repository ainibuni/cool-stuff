## My project

For my project, I will analyze `dataR2.csv`, which is the Breast Cancer Coimbra Data Set obtained from UCI Machine Learning Repository. 

## Install R packages

To analyze the data you will need to install some `R` packages. The required packages can be installed by running the following command from the project folder. 

``` bash
make install
```

## Execute the analysis

To execute the analysis, from the project folder you can run

``` bash
make report.html
```

This will create a file called `report.html` output in your directory that contains the results. 


## Makefile help

To get some information about the Makefile, from the project folder you can run

``` bash
make help
```
